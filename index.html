            <p class="description">By Owen Yang, Berlen Zhang, Sohan Raval, Christian Guerra</p>
            <p class="intro-description">You’ve likely heard that too much sugar and processed food can lead to diabetes, but 
                what does that really mean? According to the Cleveland Clinic, diabetes occurs when blood sugar (glucose) 
                levels are too high, increasing the risk of complications like heart disease, nerve damage, and kidney failure. 
                But it doesn’t happen overnight. Prediabetes is an early warning sign, offering a crucial chance to turn things around. 
                The good news? The right foods can play a powerful role in preventing diabetes and restoring healthy blood sugar 
                levels before it’s too late. Let's see what these right foods actually are. (For best functionality, please switch your browser to Google Chrome!)</p>

            <p class="intermediate-description">
                Almost 98 million Americans (1/3 of all Americans) are prediabetic according to the
                <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/communication-resources/1-in-3-americans.html" target="_blank">CDC</a>. The two graphs below depict what makes a food bad for a prediabetic.
                The first graph shows a good example of a food that has minimal glucose spikes after consumption, while the second graph shows an example of a food that has a high glucose spike after consumption.
                Everyone knows that eating high sugary foods like cookies, ice cream, and drinking soda further detriments one's diabetic
                condition. But do you know about the seemingly healthy foods that spike your glucose levels and put you at further risk
                for Type II diabetes? Since now you know what makes a food bad for someone with prediabetes, let's see if you can guess which foods are good and bad for prediabetics! Continue below to play our game and test
                whether you are eating any of the foods that are spiking your glucose levels!
